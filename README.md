# Traumatic Brain Injuries: Patient Data Analysis

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a highly complex and heterogeneous disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is rapidly emerging as one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.
The project examines the distinct variations in symptoms of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) based on demographic factors and developing a database to facilitate access to data records for key attributes.

## Objectives

-Create a structured Data warehouse to readily access patient data at any given time for sponsor's research goals

-Gain valuable insights to enhance treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes based on demographics by leveraging Tableay Dashboards

-Construct tree-based models to understand the impact of key patient demographics, such as age and gender, on the incidence of TBI 

### Tools used

- R 

- SQL

- Tableau

- Tree based modeling techniques
